- üì° Peer-to-peer sync across devices  
- üß± Modular, themeable social pages  
- üìö Public and private media libraries

## üß† What is gHosted?

gHosted is a tool to reclaim control of your digital identity, content, and connections. It's:
- A decentralized media manager  
- A user-owned social network  
- A multi-device sync platform  
- A skinable framework for digital publishing

Everything is local-first, IPFS-backed, signed with your DID, and optionally shareable with others via direct sync or peer pinning.

You can build a homepage, customize how it looks, choose how your posts behave (like Twitter, Facebook, or GitHub), and share that profile with others ‚Äî who can help keep it alive by pinning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Personas
- Each user creates one or more **personas** (DID-based).
- A persona has:
  - A public profile (homepage)
  - Linked post databases (Twitter-style, blog-style, etc.)
  - Privacy rules (public, private, friends-only, group)

### Post Databases
- Modular post databases define post types and limits:
  - `twitter.db` ‚Üí short text posts (X-style)
  - `facebook.db` ‚Üí media-rich status updates
  - `github.db` ‚Üí changelogs, commits, releases
- Each post is:
  - Cryptographically signed
  - Saved to IPFS
  - Subscribable & cacheable by others

### Frontend/Theme Layer
- Homepage is fully themeable (HTML/CSS/JS or predefined skins)
- Users can apply:
  - MySpace-style pages
  - Classic forums
  - Modern card views
- UI loads content from the post databases, modular and dynamic

### Social Mesh
- Friends and groups can pin your content to help it persist
- Users can subscribe to a full profile or a specific database
- Devices obey sync rules (e.g., "sync photos to phone", "cache books to server")
